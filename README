Yeah, so, amazingly, the script will download a wallpaper and save it... As of now, it's more of a dirty hack to get it to do that. 
It will become (very) much more sophisticated. As of now, -u must be passed for the script to run. -g should also work fine, 
but there will be glitches and bugs. The script still only downloads and saves an image. Automatic naming of the file is not well-tested,
and probably buggy. (See pywallman.py -h)
