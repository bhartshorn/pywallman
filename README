The script now supports downloading a wallpaper, placing it properly in a directory and inserting the md5 hash
and other information into an sqlite3 database. Make sure you either change the default_database variable, or
create ~/.pywallman. The sqlite work right now is very primitive - it doesn't even check if the image is 
already in the database - please be sure to do that yourself. ;) I also need to escape spaces in descriptions
so it can properly store them - use underscores for now.

Supported actions:
-l for adding local files to the db (Supply file name and location.
-g genre/folder to place the wallpaper in
-u to supply the url to download
-d for description within the database
-q for quiet/non-verbose, not recomended
-f for filename to save image as, does not set extension automatically, so please do that yourself.

Feel free to give it a try, run it through it's paces, and contact me if something goes wrong. You can get
me on msn at go__cart91 at hotmail dot com, on irc at freenode, #archlinux (privmsg me), or by email with
the same email as my msn account.
